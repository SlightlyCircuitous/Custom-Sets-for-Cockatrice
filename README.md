# Custom SLD Sets for Cockatrice
Currently, the cards.xml file used by [Cockatrice](https://github.com/Cockatrice/) to display card images lumps all the Secret Lair Drops together into one set (SLD) and Cockatrice only shows art for the most recent SLD printing of a card as a result of this. This makes sense from a clerical perspective, as Wizards of the Coast also considers all the Drops to be a single set.

However, this makes it impossible to choose which art to use for cards printed in several Drops (like Sol Ring) and very difficult to choose whether to use the Secret Lair art or the normal art for cards on a Drop by Drop basis unless you do some very specific and tedious prioritizing.

This repository contains separate .xml files for some of the Secret Lair Drops, to allow for more fine-grained art choice. These can be dropped into the Custom Sets Folder and then prioritized to your liking like any other real set. 

# How to Use
1) Download the .xml's for the sets that you want
2) Place them in the 'customsets' folder for Cockatrice (Card Database -> Open Custom Sets should take you right there)
3) Change the 'xx' in each file name to some unique two digit number, with a leading zero if necesary (01, 02, 03, etc)
4) Restart Cockatrice and confirm the enabling of new sets
5) Prioritize the new sets as needed in Card Database -> Manage sets...
